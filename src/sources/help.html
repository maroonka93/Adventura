<h2>1. Goal of the game</h2>
<p>You find yourself in a kingdom far, far away. The princess of said kingdom has been abducted by a dragon and it is your job to find and rescue her.</p>

<h2>2. World</h2>
<p>In the beginning of the game, you find yourself in front of gates to both castle and village. Castle and village are transitory rooms, hallways so to speak. You can enter many other rooms from these two, however many rooms are locked and can only be entered if and when you have the right item in your inventory. You can only enter rooms which are neighbouring to the one you currently find yourself in, i.e. those marked as "exits".</p>
<p>Many rooms hold one or more things. You can try to either pick them up or look into them - they can contain another thing. If that is the case, the thing found inside of the other is automatically added to your inventory. Sometimes a thing is locked and can't be picked up unless you have the right item in your inventory. If you do, the item is replaced in your inventory with the thing you picked up.</p>

<h2>3. Control</h2>
<p>To control the game, you can either use buttons or write commands in the field in the bottom.</p>
<h3>i. Going to another room</h3>
<p>To switch rooms, you can either left click on a button in the bar marked "exits" or you can type command "go to " + name of the room you want to go to.</p>
<p>If the answer of the game is "You don't have the right item to enter this room.", it means that the room is locked and you don't have the necessary item in your inventory.</p>
<h3>ii. Picking up things</h3>
<p>To pick up a thing, you can either left click on a button in the bar marked "Things in room" or you can type command "pick up " + name of the thing you want to pick up.</p>
<p>If the answer of the game is "(Thing) can't be picked up.", it could mean that the thing is locked and you don't have the necessary item in your inventory to pick it up.</p>
<h3>iii. Looking into things</h3>
<p>To look into a thing, you can either right click on a button in the bar marked "Things in room" or you can type command "look into " + name of the thing you want to look into.</p>
<p>If the answer of the game is "(Thing) is empty.", it doesn't contain another thing. Otherwise you discover a new item which is automatically added to your inventory.</p>
<h3>iv. Other commands</h3>
<p>Commands "draw map", "list exits", "list inventory", "get help" and "end game" are redundant with GUI, however can still be used.


<h3>Hope you enjoy this game!</h3>
